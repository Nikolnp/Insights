# Molecular Similarity Analysis

This Python script is designed to analyze molecular strings for similarity against a set of target molecules using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity metrics. The analysis includes extensive data visualization to better understand the relationships and distributions within the dataset.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts molecular strings and targets into a numerical format suitable for analysis.
- **Cosine Similarity Measurement**: Computes similarity scores between molecular strings and targets.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes histograms, word clouds, scatter plots, and more to visualize data insights effectively.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Uses K-Means clustering to group similar molecular strings.
